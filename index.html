 	 Chillennium is the largest student-run game jam in the world. Participants (in teams of 1-4) have 48 hours to plan, design, and develop a video game from scratch based on around a theme. For more information, visit the official <a style="font-size:1em;" href="http://www.chillennium.com/index.html" target="_blank"> <i>Chillennium Website</i></a>.

 	 I attended Chillennium 2018 in a team with three other friends where we developed a game based on the "Transformation" theme. The game we made, "Mineral, Parchment, Shears!" is a 2D side-scrolling runner where the player must 'transform' between rock, paper, and scissors to defeat oncoming enemies.
 	</p>
<br />
	<p>
	 We programmed the game using Javascript and WebGL. The reason being that he game would be playable in browser and be more accesible. I mainly worked on the artistic design and coding portions of the game. Below is a button to play the game in a new tab.

 		<p>
 			After my first two semesters in college, I wanted to continue to work on programing projects. I decided to expand upon what I was taught in my introductory programing class (in C++); using an external library (called SDL 2.0), I was able to import and render textures and sprites to a window screen. With this, I was able to program three simple games thoughtout the summer: Hangman, Floodit!, and Tetris.
