					<p><a href="https://tagdigda.wixsite.com/gamedev">TAGD</a> (Texas A&M Game Developers) is the <a href="https://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a> (International Game Developers Association) chapter here at A&M. The organization provides a means for students to both learn how to create and develop games and foster a community of members who are passionate about game development. They help teach development fundamentals and promote the creation of games through workshops, game jams, and team projects. </p>
					<p>I have been a member of TAGD for 4 semesters; I am also the current Internal Developer. As the Internal Developer, I help create and lead workshops, organize the annual TAGD game jams, provide resources to the club regarding art, design, and development, and assist members with programming related questions.</p>
