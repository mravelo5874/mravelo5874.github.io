					<p> 
					ChainOfCmd was my third submission for the semester-wide TAGD Game Jam. The theme this time was "Chain Reaction", so I decided to create a game that takes input from Twitch Chat in order to move the player in a sort of 'chain-reaction' style. I decided to join the jam on a solo team, both because I wanted the experience of creating a whole game and all its assets on my own and because I recently became an officer for the organisation so I felt it fair to work alone. Overall I ended up placing right outside the top three in fourth place. However, I believe this to be one of the best overall games I have created to date. I created all the art assets, music, code, and design for the game.

					<p> Ascension: Escape The Well was created for TAGD's second semester-wide game jam. The theme for this semester was "Stuck Together", so I designed a game where you and your friends are 'stuck together' in a well and must escape to win. I was inspired by many of the games that I was playing at the time. These include: <a style="font-size:1em;" href="http://www.towerfall-game.com/" target="_blank"><i>TowerFall</i></a> for its fast-paced multiplayer gameplay and its simplistic combat system. <a style="font-size:1em;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee" target="_blank"><i>SSB Melee</i></a> for its technical movement and its fast-paced gameplay aswell. And <a style="font-size:1em;" href="http://nidhogggame.com/" target="_blank"><i>Nidhogg</i></a> for its minimalistic yet dynamic artstyle.

					<h3>&#9632; November 2018: TAGD Fall 2018 Game Jam:</h3>
					<img src="images/deep_pockets.gif" alt="deep_pockets.gif" width="475" height="295" align="right" hspace="20" />
				
					<p> Deep Pockets was a game made for the first ever TAGD (Texas A&M Game Developers) semester wide game jam, the theme being "Winning to Lose". I ended up winning the award for best programming, the other awards being best art, best design, and crowd favorite.</p>

			 		<p> The game is a 2D Rogue-like where the goal is to collect as much treasure as possible on every floor. The levels are procedurally generated and contain enemies that the player must fight off in order to have them drop items. At the  end of a floor, the player drops down into a shop where they can sell all their items collected in order to upgrade their stats. The game features mechanics like: a weighted inventory system that allows the player to hold up to a certain amount of weight of items, combat system that lets the player attack in 8 different directions, and a difficulty system that makes enemies deal more damage, have more health, and spawn more often as the player progresses throughout sequential floors.</p>

			 		<p> This was my first project using the Unity game engine. Throughout the development of the game, I came to appreciate the engine the more I learned about how to use it. I also came to realize the value of planning out a project beforehand as compared to just on the fly.</p>

					<img src="images/mps.gif" alt="mps.gif" width="475" height="295" align="right" hspace="20" />

					<p>
				 	 Chillennium is the largest student-run game jam in the world. Participants (in teams of 1-4) have 48 hours to plan, design, and develop a video game from scratch based around a theme. For more information, visit the official <a style="font-size:1em;" href="http://www.chillennium.com/index.html" target="_blank"> <i>Chillennium Website</i></a>.
				 	</p>
					<p>
				 	 I attended Chillennium 2018 in a team with three other friends where we developed a game based on the "Transformation" theme. The game we made, "Mineral, Parchment, Shears!" is a 2D side-scrolling runner where the player must 'transform' between rock, paper, and scissors to defeat oncoming enemies.
				 	</p>
					<p>
					 We programmed the game using Javascript and WebGL, the reason being that he game would be playable in browser and be more accessible. I mainly worked on the artistic design and coding portions of the game.

					<h3>&#9632; Summer 2018: C++ with SDL 2.0:</h3>	
			 		<img src="images/floodit_screenshot.PNG" alt="floodit_screenshot.png"width="250" height="250" hspace="20" align="left"/>

			 		<p>
			 			After my first two semesters in college, I wanted to continue to work on programming projects. I decided to expand upon what I was taught in my introductory programming class (in C++); using an external library (called SDL 2.0), I was able to import and render textures and sprites to a window screen. With this, I was able to program three simple games thoughout the summer: Hangman, Floodit!, and Tetris.
			 		</p>	
			 		<p>
			 			I programmed the games in C++ because that was the only language I was familar with at the time. The disadvantage of this is that one has to download and run the application on their own device as compared to playing the game in browser.
			 		</p>

			 		<h5>I used <a style="font-size:1em;" href="http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/">Lazy Foo' Productions</a> tutorial on game programming with SDL 2.0.</h5>
